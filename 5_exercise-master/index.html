            "Hakuna-matata" (pronounced [hɑˈkunɑ mɑˈtɑtɑ]) is a Swahili language
            phrase from Kenya, meaning "no trouble" or "no problems" (literally
            hakuna: "there is no/there are no"; matata: "troubles" or
            "problems".) The phrase was used in Disney animated film The Lion
            King and its 2019 remake (which feature a song named after the
            phrase), in which it is translated as "no worries". The song is
            often heard at resorts, hotels, and other places appealing to the
            tourist trade.[clarification needed] In 2018, Disney's trademark of
            the phrase in the US caused controversy in East Africa.

            In 1983, German group Boney M. released "Jambo—Hakuna Matata", an
            English-language version of Them Mushrooms song Jambo Bwana. Liz
            Mitchell provided the song's lead vocals, backed by Reggie Tsiboe,
            Frank Farian, Cathy Bartney, Madeleine Davis and Judy Cheeks. The
            single was intended to be included in the group's untitled seventh
            album, to be released in the fall of 1983. Due to a poor chart
            performance (No. 48 in the German charts), the single ultimately was
            not included in the album (which was completely reworked and not
            released until May 1984 as Ten Thousand Lightyears).

            In 1994 the Walt Disney Animation Studios animated movie The Lion
            King brought the phrase international recognition, featuring it
            prominently in the plot and devoting a song to it. A meerkat and a
            warthog, Timon and Pumbaa, teach Simba that he should forget his
            troubled past and live in the present. The song was written by Elton
            John (music) and Tim Rice (lyrics), who found the term in a Swahili
            phrasebook. It was nominated for Best Original Song at the 1995
            Academy Awards, and was later ranked the 99th best song in movie
            history by the American Film Institute on a list of 100.
